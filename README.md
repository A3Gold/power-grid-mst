# Introduction

A C++ project that applies data structures and algorithm principles to find the lowest cost way to connect a power grid. The power grid is represented as a weighted, undirected graph. A minimum cost solution to connect the power grid is found by applying Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
